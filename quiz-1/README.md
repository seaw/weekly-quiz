Suppose you are given an array stock_prices_yesterday of the prices of a stock over time.

Write an efficient algorithm for computing the best profit you can make

from first buying 1 share of the stock, and then selling that 1 share later.

Note that you must buy before you sell (no "sorting").

For example, if stock_prices_yesterday=[5, 6, 4, 7, 9, 8, 8],

then the correct answer is to buy the stock at $4,

and then sell it at $9, for a profit of $5.

To test your code, you can run the following script in terminal.

ruby sample-stock-prices-tester.rb
