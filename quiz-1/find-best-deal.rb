# Suppose you are given an array stock_prices_yesterday of the prices of a stock over time.
# Write an efficient algorithm for computing the best profit you can make
# from first buying 1 share of the stock, and then selling that 1 share later.
#
# Note that you must buy before you sell (no "shorting").
#
# For example, if stock_prices_yesterday=[5, 6, 4, 7, 9, 8, 8],
# then the correct answer is to buy the stock at $4, and then sell it at $9,
# for a profit of $5.
